VER 0.1

BUGS:
	When moving through portal, if you shoot a portal the loop sometimes runs twice causing a very extended
	period of not moving.

	Both portals disappear momentarily whilst one is being fired.

FIXES:
	Player can now move whilst the portal is being fired.


CONTROLS:
	WASD - Moves player
	Q - Fire portal to the left
	E - Fire portal to the right
