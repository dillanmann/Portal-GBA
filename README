PORTAL-GBA project by Dillan Mann
05/12/2011
VER 0.3

CONTROLS:
	WASD - Moves player
	Q - Fire portal to the left
	E - Fire portal to the right

TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
	
	Portals landing on top and bottom of screen

	Gravity

BUGS:

	None


FIXED:
	Player can now move whilst the portal is being fired.

	Both portals momentarily disappear when a portal is being fired.

	When moving through portal, if you shoot a portal the loop sometimes runs twice causing a very extended
	period of not moving.

	Player appears on the left hand side of the screen if they go
	off the right hand side of the screen.
